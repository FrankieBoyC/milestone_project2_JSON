<h1 align="center">Milestone Project Two - JSON </h1>
<h2 align="left">Description </h2>
This is the JSON version of the second milestone project I worked on for my first Python certificate. It is a basic program built on Python that demonstrates my ability to perform basic data manipulation on a JSON file. It is a basic reading list storage program.
<h2 align="left">How to Use</h2>
To use this is simple. It is a text-based user interphase so it can be run in any IDE, after the program runs go through the prompt and select the option you want. You can add books to your list, remove, list out your books, or mark them as read.
